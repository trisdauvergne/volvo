This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Process

- Created a next app with the TypeScript template and installed React and React-router Dom. I am relatively new to NextJS but understand how helpful it is for routing, so created a page for Learn (which would render the car tiles) to see how routing works
- Added the data files to test rendering the data in the app and created a reusable car tile component to test this
- Moved on to routing as I knew the product owner had specified we could generate links to learn and shop urls with the product ID

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
